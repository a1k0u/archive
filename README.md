This is my own archive to show activity in learning programming. Most of the time I'm researching new things and I want to share this on GitHub. There is nothing new here, this code can be written after tutorials, articles, documentation, books, etc.
But I wrote it myself, you can be sure that I know what I learned :)

Some parts of this code may be lead by comments and some useful URLs. Please enjoy and explore it!
